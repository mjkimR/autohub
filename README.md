# Auto Hub

Auto Hub is a personal development automation hub connecting GitHub and Codex cloud.
Building on top of the existing Scheduler Manager foundation (schedules, execution history, and connector management),
it incrementally constructs capabilities to manage work progress across multiple repositories.

## Direction

- A single connection maps to **1 GitHub repository**. There is no external issue tracker; work is specified in pull requests.
- **Hub** handles PR enrollment, Codex mention dispatch, progress tracking, fix requests, retries, pause/resume, and merge policies.
- **Codex cloud** implements requests posted as `@codex` PR comments and pushes to the PR branch.
- **GitHub Actions in the target repository** handles environment setup, testing, linting, and building.
- Existing CIs can be connected as-is, while repositories without CI are provided with [templates](templates/github-actions/README.md).
- Differences between repositories are expressed through required verification, review/merge policies, and the repository's own tests.

The target workflow is: `User opens PR → Codex mention implementation → PR verification → Fix or merge`.
Drawing on operational experience from `g-sandbox`, Godot-specific logic, planning notes, and multi-prototype rules are kept out of the core engine.

## Implementation Status

The existing scheduler and management UI are preserved. Hub supports saved project connections, CI observation, explicit PR enrollment, durable run and delivery history, retries, CI-fix requests, cancellation, and policy-controlled merge automation.

A repository is registered as a connection, and its connection check confirms that CI is readable and verifies a current PR. Enrolling an open same-repository PR records an immutable task snapshot, creates a durable delivery, reconciles its marker against GitHub comments, and posts the `@codex` request only when no matching comment exists. A new PR head moves the run through CI observation; failed CI can trigger a bounded fix request, while a passing result proceeds through the configured merge checks.

The CI templates remain starter files for manual installation in target repositories. Centralized reusable-workflow distribution is deferred. The detailed delivery state, verification record, optional canaries, and other deferred work are maintained in [Delivery Status](docs/delivery-status.md).

## Development

The backend is built with Python/FastAPI in `modules/hub`, and the frontend is built with Svelte/TypeScript in `modules/hub-ui`.
PostgreSQL is the standard database, with SQLite used for default testing.

The single source of truth for execution commands and default arguments is [justfile](justfile). Check available commands with `just --list`.

```sh
just init
just dev-run hub
just dev-run hub-ui
just lint
just check
just test
```

Lint, checks, builds, and tests use `app-tools run` to print compact results and
save complete output at the printed `log:` path. Backend lint includes app-common
architecture checks; `just lint-check` checks both modules without changing files.
Initialize the Python development environment with `just init hub` before using
these commands, including frontend-only checks.

For connector credential encryption setup, refer to the [Hub module documentation](modules/hub/README.md#connector-credential-encryption).

## Agent skills

Microsoft APM 0.30.0 installs the `app-common` skill with `just skills` (also run
by backend initialization). `just link-skills` remains a compatibility entry point.
`apm.yml` pins the Git dependency to the same pushed commit as the shared frontend
ESLint policy. Python runtime packages retain their independently pinned commit;
no sibling app-common checkout is required. Install APM with
`uv tool install apm-cli==0.30.0`. Private repositories require Git credentials in
local and cloud agent environments.

Normal setup runs `apm install --frozen`. To adopt a newer skill version, change
`ref` in `apm.yml` to the intended pushed commit, then run:

```sh
apm install --refresh
apm audit --ci
```

From workbench, `just skills-refresh autohub` performs both steps. Refresh honors
the declared ref; it does not advance a pinned commit to main automatically.
Track `apm.yml`, `apm.lock.yaml`, and the deployed skill files together. Ignore
`apm_modules/`; never edit installed copies. This setup does not use a project
`.apm/` directory. Keep the skill ref aligned when updating app-common packages.
