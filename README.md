# Auto Hub

Auto Hub is a personal development automation hub connecting GitHub and Codex cloud.
Building on top of the existing Scheduler Manager foundation (schedules, execution history, and connector management),
it incrementally constructs capabilities to manage work progress across multiple repositories.

## Direction

- A single connection maps to **1 GitHub repository**. There is no external issue tracker; work is specified in pull requests.
- **Hub** handles PR enrollment, Codex mention dispatch, progress tracking, fix requests, retries, pause/resume, and merge policies.
- **Codex cloud** implements requests posted as `@codex` PR comments and pushes to the PR branch.
- **GitHub Actions in the target repository** handles environment setup, testing, linting, and building.
- Existing CIs can be connected as-is, while repositories without CI are provided with [templates](templates/github-actions/README.md).
- Differences between repositories are expressed through required verification, review/merge policies, and the repository's own tests.

The target workflow is: `User opens PR → Codex mention implementation → PR verification → Fix or merge`.
Drawing on operational experience from `g-sandbox`, Godot-specific logic, planning notes, and multi-prototype rules are kept out of the core engine.

## Implementation Status

The existing scheduler and management UI are preserved. Hub supports saved project connections, CI observation, explicit PR enrollment, durable run and delivery history, retries, CI-fix requests, cancellation, and policy-controlled merge automation.

A repository is registered as a connection, and its connection check confirms that CI is readable and verifies a current PR. Enrolling an open same-repository PR records an immutable task snapshot, creates a durable delivery, reconciles its marker against GitHub comments, and posts the `@codex` request only when no matching comment exists. A new PR head moves the run through CI observation; failed CI can trigger a bounded fix request, while a passing result proceeds through the configured merge checks.

The CI templates remain starter files for manual installation in target repositories. Centralized reusable-workflow distribution is deferred. The detailed delivery state, verification record, optional canaries, and other deferred work are maintained in [Delivery Status](docs/delivery-status.md).

## Development

The backend is built with Python/FastAPI in `modules/hub`, and the frontend is built with Svelte/TypeScript in `modules/hub-ui`.
PostgreSQL is the standard database, with SQLite used for default testing.

The single source of truth for execution commands and default arguments is [justfile](justfile). Check available commands with `just --list`.

```sh
just init
just dev-run hub
just dev-run hub-ui
just lint
just check
just test
```

For connector credential encryption setup, refer to the [Hub module documentation](modules/hub/README.md#connector-credential-encryption).

## Agent skills

Microsoft APM 0.30.0 installs the `app-common` skill with `just skills` (also run
by backend initialization). `just link-skills` remains a compatibility entry point.
The manifest uses `../app-common/agents`, the sibling workbench checkout; after
source changes run `apm install` to refresh the snapshot and lockfile, then
`apm audit --ci`. Normal setup uses `apm install --frozen`.

For a standalone checkout, replace the local dependency in `apm.yml` with:

```yaml
    - git: mjkimR/app-common
      path: agents
      ref: <release-tag>
      skills: [app-common]
```

Use a published ref containing the APM collection layout, then run `apm install`.
Track the manifest, lockfile, and `.agents/skills/app-common/` and
`.claude/skills/app-common/` copies together. Ignore `apm_modules/`; never edit
installed copies. This setup does not use a project `.apm/` directory.
