# AI Catalog Implementation Notes

Explains how AI Catalog is structured and functions in code from a developer's perspective.
Operational rules and contracts are documented in [AI Catalog Gateway](ai-catalogs.md).

## Overview

An AI Catalog is a **gateway** representing a single AI account or plan. Every unit of work sent to an AI requests admission to exactly one catalog.
Quota holds, recovery, and concurrency limits are governed by the catalog, not individual runs.

Quota models differ by provider.

| Provider | Quota Model | When Hub Detects Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Usage window based on first dispatch. Short / long refresh cycles | **After receiving** a limit-exceeded reply |
| Jules | Concurrency limit + 24-hour rolling daily task limit (Pro: 100/day, 15 concurrent) | Counted locally **before dispatching** |

Therefore, catalog responsibilities are divided into two independent axes:

| Axis | Selection Key | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quota Policy (`QuotaPolicy`) | `catalog.kind` | When work can be dispatched, and how quota recovers |
| Execution Adapter (`ExecutionAdapter`) | `catalog.adapter` | How pipeline requests are dispatched and how replies are read |

### Module Map

| Path (`modules/hub/app/features/…`) | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ai_catalogs/models.py` | `AICatalog`, `AICatalogDispatch` (ledger), `AICatalogSession` (session tracking) |
| `ai_catalogs/services.py` | Gateway: locking, common rejections, concurrency check, ledger recording, hold / activation / config / connector management |
| `ai_catalogs/repos.py` | Queries and aggregations. `admits_dispatch()` (SQL version of common check), `active_dispatch_count()`, ledger query/recording |
| `ai_catalogs/policies/base.py` | `QuotaPolicy` protocol, `utc()`, `hold_state()` |
| `ai_catalogs/policies/codex_window.py` | Codex usage window, refresh cycle, recovery probe |
| `ai_catalogs/policies/daily_quota.py` | Daily task quota limit (`rolling` / `calendar`) |
| `ai_catalogs/policies/registry.py` | kind → policy mapping |
| `ai_catalogs/api/v1.py` | `/api/v1/ai-catalogs` |
| `project_management/pipeline_runs/adapters/base.py` | `ExecutionAdapter` protocol, `DeliveryTarget`, `DeliveryReceipt`, `AgentReply` |
| `project_management/pipeline_runs/adapters/codex_github_mention.py` | Post PR mention, re-align markers, parse Codex replies |
| `project_management/pipeline_runs/adapters/registry.py` | adapter → implementation mapping. Unimplemented adapters return 501 |
| `project_management/pipeline_runs/usecases/lifecycle.py` | Run state transitions and persistence; processes adapter results; resolves the project's catalog on enrollment and resume |
| `project_management/projects/services.py` | Validates a project's `github.ai_catalog_id` (only catalogs whose adapter supports pipeline delivery) |
| `hub-ui/…/ai-catalogs/catalog-kinds.ts` | Per-kind UI registry: policy dialog component, button label, card summary |
| `execution/tasks/domains/jules/client.py` | Jules REST v1alpha client |
| `execution/tasks/domains/jules/service.py` | Jules session initiation and synchronization |
| `execution/tasks/domains/jules/task.py` | Scheduled tasks `jules.session`, `jules.sync_sessions` |
| `project_management/agent_schedules/` | Project-owned agent schedules: `ProjectAgentSchedule` rows that derive and own one `ScheduleConfig` each, the per-catalog sync entry, and their API |

## Core Concepts

### Admission

`AICatalogService.request_dispatch(session, catalog_id, run_id | None, dispatch_key, now)` returns `Admission(catalog, rejection)`. It never raises an exception.

1. **Common checks.** Rejects if the catalog is disabled, in a `disabled` or `unknown` state, or has an unexpired `quota_blocked` hold. The same criteria are represented in SQL by `AICatalogRepository.admits_dispatch()`, which is used when the scheduler queries dispatch targets. Both implementations must always be updated in tandem.
2. **Policy.** `policy.admit(session, catalog, dispatch_key, now)` applies recovery transitions and returns rejection reasons if needed.
3. **Concurrency.** `active_dispatch_count` must be strictly less than `policy.effective_concurrency`.
   - A pipeline run occupies a slot when it is `implementing`, or when it is `dispatching` and its active attempt is also `dispatching`.
   - A session occupies a slot until it reaches `completed` or `failed`.
4. **Ledger.** Once all checks pass, `reserve_dispatch()` records an entry in the ledger.

When rejected, the caller commits the transaction (`session.commit()`) before raising HTTP 409. This ensures state transitions made by the policy during evaluation (such as newly triggered daily holds or probe phase transitions) are preserved rather than rolled back.

### Dispatch Key and Ledger (`ai_catalog_dispatches`)

- Records one row per admitted unit of work. `dispatch_key` is unique.
  - Pipeline: `delivery:<ExecutionDelivery.id>`
  - Jules: `session:<AICatalogSession.id>`
- Retrying with the same key does not insert a new row and preserves the original record. Policies exclude their own key from quota calculation (`exclude_dispatch_key`).
- Entries older than 30 days are pruned, for every catalog, when writing a new record.
- Currently, only `DailyQuotaPolicy` reads the ledger.

### Session Tracking (`ai_catalog_sessions`)

- Tracks provider sessions initiated by Hub outside the pull request pipeline until completion. Currently used only for Jules.
- `work_type` is `task` or `report` (`SESSION_WORK_TYPES`); `repository` is the GitHub repository the session worked in.
- The state remains `dispatching` until creation is confirmed; once confirmed, the provider's state is stored in lowercase.
- On completion the session's final agent message is stored as `result_summary` (the deliverable of a report). A task session's pull request is adopted into the matching project's pipeline and linked through `pipeline_run_id`; when adoption is skipped, `failure_detail` says why. Nothing else of the session's output is stored.

## Flows

### Pipeline Dispatch (`PipelineRunUseCase.dispatch_implementation`)

```text
Verify lease → Check project changes (if changed, BLOCKED without consuming slot)
→ resolve_execution_adapter()             # Raises 501 before admission if unimplemented
→ Query active attempt → Confirm delivery # Create if missing; create new delivery if already posted
→ request_dispatch(catalog, run, "delivery:<id>")
     ├ Rejected: commit → 409
     └ Passed: attempt = DISPATCHING
→ (Outside transaction) _guard_dispatch → adapter.deliver(observer, target, request, n, authorize)
→ Record delivery (external_id, posted_at, url) → IMPLEMENTING → record_dispatch_delivered()
```

During observation (`advance_run`), the flow proceeds as follows:
- `adapter.collect_replies()` returns a list of `AgentReply` objects. Lifecycle persists these as `ExecutionReply`.
- If a quota reply is present, increments `quota_block_count` on the run and calls `record_quota_event(catalog_id, observed_at)`.
- Silent retry thresholds utilize the adapter's `silent_timeout` and `silent_block_reason`.

### Jules Session Start (`JulesSessionService.start`)

```text
_catalog_access: verify kind == jules, connector(provider=jules, enabled) → decrypt token
→ _observe: refresh uncompleted sessions (finished sessions release slots)
→ request_dispatch(catalog, None, "session:<id>")
     ├ Rejected: commit → 409
     └ Passed: AICatalogSession(state=dispatching, title="<title> [hub-session:<id>]")
→ POST /v1alpha/sessions
     ├ Success: update name / state / url / outputs[].pullRequest.url
     ├ 429: mark session failed + record_quota_event (conservatively treated as reaching daily limit)
     ├ Other 4xx: mark session failed
     └ 5xx / Network error: remain dispatching → reconciled later by title
```

Processing in `_observe`:
- Sessions with an external name (`external_name`) are updated via `GET sessions/{id}`.
- Sessions lacking an external name are reconciled by scanning recent sessions via `find_session_by_title` (latest 3 pages × 100 items).
- Sessions that remain unlocated after 1 hour are marked as `failed`.
- Lookup errors are ignored so observation failures do not prevent starting new tasks.
- A session observed as `COMPLETED` has its activities read (`GET sessions/{id}/activities`, up to 10 pages) for the last `agentMessaged` text, stored as `result_summary`. A failed read leaves it empty; it is not retried.

### Session Completion (`JulesSessionService._complete` / `_adopt_pull_request`)

```text
_apply: remote state in STALLED_STATES (awaiting_plan_approval, awaiting_user_feedback, paused)
        → state = failed, failure_detail names the state (the slot is released; nobody answers a scheduled session)
_complete (in the observation transaction)
  work_type == report → result_summary only
  work_type == task, no outputs[].pullRequest.url → failure_detail = "Task session completed without opening a pull request"
adoption pass (after the loop, over list_sessions_awaiting_adoption: completed task sessions with a pull request,
               pipeline_run_id NULL and failure_detail NULL — so a crash before the verdict is retried next sync)
  ├ URL repository != session.repository → not adopted
  ├ no enabled project for the repository, or automation.auto_enroll_sessions == false → not adopted
  ├ PipelineRunUseCase.enroll(project, EnrollPullRequest(pull_number, implemented=True))
  │    ├ run created at awaiting_ci with one RUNNING implementation attempt (external_status
  │    │ "implemented-externally", standard request snapshot so a CI failure derives a ci-fix from it)
  │    └ ProjectError → the pull request's active run, if somebody enrolled it first, is linked instead;
  │      otherwise (project disabled, closed pull request, …) → failure_detail
  └ any other exception → logged, failure_detail = "Pull request adoption failed: …"; the sync continues
```

The run belongs to the project's catalog (Codex by default), so CI fixes and conflict fixes are delivered by the project's adapter as for any other run. Adoption runs after the session's own transaction commits and touches GitHub only through the standard enrollment read. Resuming an adopted run whose last attempt is the external implementation returns it to `awaiting_ci` instead of replaying that attempt's request.

### Agent Schedules (`AgentScheduleService`, `AgentScheduleRepository`)

```text
create/update → project must have github_repository
             → catalog.kind in SESSION_TASKS and work_type in CATALOG_SESSION_WORK_TYPES[kind], catalog enabled
             → derived payload validated with JulesSessionPayload before any write
             → write_config: ScheduleConfig(name "Agent <id8>: <title> (<project>)", task_func by kind,
               payload = session_payload(project, row, catalog),
               enabled = row.enabled and project.enabled and catalog.enabled and project has a repository,
               next_run_at recomputed when the trigger changed or the entry turned on)
             → ensure_sync_schedule(catalog): one hub-named "<kind>.sync_sessions" entry ("Agent sync: <key>")
               per catalog while any row uses it; operator entries for the catalog are not touched
lock order   → project FOR UPDATE, then catalogs FOR UPDATE in id order (lock_catalogs), then config rows;
               AICatalogService.set_enabled locks its catalog first too, so the two writers never deadlock
delete       → row and owned config removed, sync entry removed with the last row
run_now      → owned config.next_run_at = NULL (the dispatcher's "run immediately" sentinel)
```

- `ProjectService.update` calls `AgentScheduleRepository.resync_project`, `ProjectService.delete` calls `delete_for_project`, and `AICatalogService.set_enabled` calls `resync_catalog`. The repository module imports models only, so the project service can use it without a cycle (`AgentScheduleService` depends on `ProjectService`).
- `ManagedScheduleHook` on `ScheduleConfigService` refuses update and delete of an owned config with 409; reads are untouched.
- Sessions link to schedules through `AICatalogSession.schedule_config_id`; `AICatalogRepository.list_recent_sessions_for_schedules` feeds `recent_sessions` for a whole listing in one window-function query.

### Catalog Designation (`PipelineRunUseCase.resolve_catalog`)

```text
designation None → _project_catalog (project.ai_catalog_id, else seeded personal-codex)
designation set  → get_by_key(designation)
                   └ none → enabled catalogs of kind designation.lower()
                             ├ several → 422 "matches several AI catalogs (…); name one by key"
                             └ none    → 422 "No AI catalog is named or of kind '…'"
                 → disabled → 422; adapter without pipeline delivery → 422
```

- `EnrollPullRequest.catalog` carries the designation; the webhook parses it from `@auto-run:<catalog>` (`AUTO_RUN_TRIGGER`, group `catalog`). A refused webhook enrollment is still a processed delivery with `failure_detail = "Enrollment skipped: …"`; an enrollment whose first dispatch is refused (a quota hold, say) records `"Enrolled; first dispatch deferred: …"` and the scheduler dispatches the run later.
- The resolved catalog is stored in `pipeline_runs.ai_catalog_id`; a designation is also kept in `requested_catalog_id`. `_run_catalog` (used by resume) prefers the requested catalog while it exists, is enabled, and can deliver, else the project's current selection.
- `resolve_catalog` is the single chokepoint for mapping a request to a catalog, so a router can replace it without touching enrollment or the webhook.

## Policy Summary

Detailed rules are documented in [AI Catalog Gateway](ai-catalogs.md). Here, only implementation details are highlighted.

### `CodexWindowPolicy`

- Configuration is `CodexWindowConfig`: `short_refresh_enabled`, `short_refresh_cycle_minutes`, `long_refresh_cycle_minutes`, `probe_window_minutes`. Defaults are populated upon saving.
- Runtime state is `CodexWindowState` (`probe_started_at`, `short_refresh_failure_count`, `last_refreshed_at`, `usage_window_started_at`), stored whole in `ai_catalogs.policy_state`. Each hook loads it, mutates it, and reassigns the dumped value (`_store`), because JSON columns track reassignment rather than in-place mutation.
- `on_availability_override`: A manual hold or enable switch drops an unfinished probe.
- `admit`: Transitions to `probe` if the hold has expired, or cleans up completed probes. Does not reject on its own.
- `on_delivered`: Records usage window start time and probe start time.
- `on_quota_signal`: Applies a hold based on short cycle or long cycle with added jitter.
- `on_hold_cleared`: Updates `last_refreshed_at` and resets the usage window.

### `DailyQuotaPolicy`

- Configuration is `DailyQuotaConfig`: `daily_task_limit`, `window` (`rolling` default / `calendar`), `timezone`.
- `admit`:
  - Transitions back to `normal` if hold has expired. No probe phase.
  - If the count of ledger entries within the window meets or exceeds the limit, applies a hold with jitter targeting the moment a slot opens and rejects admission.
- Slot release timestamp calculation:
  - `rolling`: Sorted ascending within window: `admitted[n - limit] + 24h`
  - `calendar`: Next local midnight. Adding one day to a zone-aware date naturally handles DST transitions.
- `on_quota_signal`:
  - `rolling`: 24-hour hold starting from provider rejection timestamp (external tasks outside hub are not recorded in the ledger).
  - `calendar`: Hold until next midnight.
- `effective_concurrency` equals `configured_concurrency`.

## Data Models

**`ai_catalogs`**

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `key`, `name`, `kind`, `adapter` | Identification info and policy/adapter selection |
| `connector_id` | Credentials for providers called directly by Hub (Jules). Codex uses the project's GitHub connection |
| `enabled`, `availability_state`, `available_at`, `availability_*` | Common gate state |
| `configured_concurrency`, `refresh_jitter_minutes` | Common configuration |
| `policy_config` (JSON) | Configuration validated by the kind policy |
| `policy_state` (JSON) | Runtime quota state owned by the kind policy (Codex usage window, probe, short-cycle failures) |

**`projects.ai_catalog_id`**: Catalog for the project's pull request work, exposed as `github.ai_catalog_id`. Empty selects `personal-codex`.

**`execution_deliveries.external_id`, `execution_replies.external_id`**: The provider's identifier returned by the adapter (a GitHub comment ID for Codex mentions).

**`ai_catalog_dispatches`**: `ai_catalog_id`, `dispatch_key` (unique), `admitted_at`. Index on `(ai_catalog_id, admitted_at)`.

**`ai_catalog_sessions`**: `ai_catalog_id`, `schedule_config_id`, `title`, `state`, `external_name` (unique), `url`, `pull_request_url`, `failure_detail`, `observed_at`

**Seed Data**
- `personal-codex` (codex / codex-github-mention)
- `personal-jules` (jules / jules-api, concurrency 15, daily limit 100 rolling, no connector)

## API

| Method | Path (`/api/v1/ai-catalogs`) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `` | List catalogs. Includes `effective_concurrency`, `held_run_count`, `active_dispatch_count`, `open_session_count`, and the capability flags `connector_provider`, `pipeline_delivery`, and `session_work_types` |
| GET | `/{key}/sessions?offset=&limit=&status=&schedule_config_id=` | A page of tracked sessions, most recent first, with `total_count` (default limit 50, max 100). `status` is `open` (not ended), `completed`, or `failed`; both filters narrow `total_count` too. Ties on `created_at` are broken by `id`, so pages never overlap. Each item carries `work_type`, `repository`, `pipeline_run_id`, and `result_summary` |
| PUT / DELETE | `/{key}/availability` | Manually set / clear hold |
| PUT | `/{key}/enabled` | Enable or disable catalog |
| PUT | `/{key}/policy-config` | Validate and normalize via kind policy's `validate_config()` before saving |
| PUT | `/{key}/connector` | Only allows connectors for matching provider (`CATALOG_CONNECTOR_PROVIDERS`) |

Project agent schedules (`/api/v1/projects/{id}/agent-schedules`): list, create, get, put, delete, and `run-now`; see [AI Catalog Gateway](ai-catalogs.md#project-agent-schedules).

Scheduled Tasks (written by agent schedules; hand-written entries still work):
- `jules.session`
  - payload: `catalog_key`, `repository` (`owner/repo`), `starting_branch`, `title`, `prompt`, `work_type` (`task` | `report`, default `task`), `auto_create_pr` (optional; defaults to true for `task`, false for `report`)
  - The prompt sent to Jules is the operator's prompt followed by the work type's delivery contract (`TASK_DELIVERY_INSTRUCTIONS` / `REPORT_DELIVERY_INSTRUCTIONS`).
- `jules.sync_sessions`
  - payload: `catalog_key`
  - Keep interval short: releasing concurrency slots, storing reports, and adopting pull requests all depend on this task's frequency.

Connector providers are `github`, `jules`, `linear`. For `jules`, the API key is stored in `token`.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Separate registries for policies and adapters | Quota models and execution mechanisms evolve independently across providers (e.g. Jules uses a quota policy without a PR pipeline adapter). |
| Return rejection as a value, commit then 409 | Rejecting via exception would roll back hold and probe transitions recorded by the policy during admission. |
| Confirm pipeline delivery **before** admission | The ledger key (`delivery:<id>`) must remain idempotent across retries to prevent duplicate counting. |
| Return 501 for unimplemented adapters **before** admission | Prevents tasks that cannot be executed from consuming quota and concurrency slots. |
| Use Jules for scheduled sessions rather than PR pipelines | The Jules API (v1alpha) cannot push to existing PR branches; `AUTO_CREATE_PR` always creates a new branch and PR. |
| Two axes: provider capability × work type, one pipeline per work type | Providers differ in what the hub can observe (Codex: pull requests only; Jules: a session API too), work differs in what it delivers (a pull request or text). Task work shares the single pull request pipeline whatever opened the pull request; reports are stored from the session. Combinations a provider cannot serve are refused before admission, like the `jules-api` 501. |
| Branch on the session's `work_type` at completion, not on the pull request | The hub knows a session's purpose when it creates it. Deciding at pull request close would depend on prompt compliance (labels, paths) and would run CI for every report. |
| Adopt a session's pull request as an already implemented run | The pipeline's implementation step would ask Codex to implement a pull request Jules already implemented. Entering at `awaiting_ci` with a synthetic RUNNING attempt keeps CI fixes, conflict fixes, and merge on the existing path. |
| Include `[hub-session:<id>]` in Jules session title | Jules session creation API lacks idempotency keys; titles enable reconciling uncertain creations. |
| Treat Jules 429 as quota events | Provider rate-limit error payload schema is undocumented; waiting conservatively is safer, and operators can manually clear holds. |
| Default daily quota window to `rolling` | Jules official documentation specifies a "rolling 24 hour window". |
| Codex runtime state in `policy_state` JSON | Kind-specific state stays off the shared table. The policy validates it through a Pydantic model and replaces the whole value under the catalog row lock. |
| Capability flags instead of kind names in the UI | The UI shows connector and session controls from `connector_provider`, and offers project catalogs from `pipeline_delivery`, so new kinds need no UI branching for those controls. |
| Project-level catalog selection, applied on resume | Enrollment uses the project's catalog; a resume starts a new attempt, so it adopts the project's current selection without splitting one delivery across catalogs. |

## Extension Guide

**Adding a New Quota Model (`kind`)**
1. Add a new value to `AICatalogKind`.
2. Implement `QuotaPolicy` (including `validate_config`). Define config as a Pydantic model with `extra="forbid"`.
3. Register the policy in `policies/registry.py`.
4. If Hub calls the provider directly, add the provider to `CATALOG_CONNECTOR_PROVIDERS` and `ConnectorProvider`.
5. Add a policy dialog component (props: `CatalogDialogProps`) and register it in `catalogKinds` in `catalog-kinds.ts`.

**Adding a New Pipeline Execution Adapter (`adapter`)**
1. Implement `ExecutionAdapter`: `deliver`, `collect_replies`, `silent_timeout`, `silent_block_reason`.
2. Register it in `_ADAPTERS` in `adapters/registry.py`. If under development, place it in `_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

**Session-based Work Outside the Pipeline**
- Follow the pattern in `jules/service.py`: Sync → `request_dispatch(..., None, "session:<id>")` → create session record → execute external call → persist result.

## Testing

| Location | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/unit/test_ai_catalogs/test_refresh_policy.py` | Gateway admission, rejection return, ledger recording conditions, Codex policy rules |
| `tests/unit/test_ai_catalogs/test_daily_quota_policy.py` | Rolling and calendar boundaries, reduced limits, clearing holds, provider rejection, config validation |
| `tests/unit/test_pipeline_runs/test_lifecycle.py` | Commit then raise on rejection, adapter resolution (501/409), quota reply handling |
| `tests/e2e/test_ai_catalogs/test_ai_catalogs_api.py` | Per-kind validation for policy-config and connector APIs, session listing, capability flags |
| `tests/e2e/test_ai_catalogs/test_jules_sessions.py` | Jules session creation, ledger, daily holds, 429 handling, reconciliation (using `httpx.MockTransport`) |
| `tests/e2e/test_projects/test_pipeline_runs_api.py` | Pipeline integration including idempotent ledger records across retried deliveries and project catalog selection |
| `modules/hub-ui/…/ai-catalogs/AICatalogsView.test.ts` | Per-kind policy editors, capability-driven controls, policy/connector saving, timezone validation, session listing |

- Catalogs in unit tests are `MagicMock(spec=AICatalog)` instances, so `kind`, `policy_config`, and `policy_state` must be populated. `test_refresh_policy.py` builds Codex state with `make_catalog(**state)` and reads it back with `state_of()`.
- UI dialogs mount when opened and move focus once while opening; tests should type multi-character values after the dialog has settled.
- Lifecycle unit tests monkeypatch `resolve_execution_adapter`.
- Compare new migrations against models with `alembic check`. SQLite cannot run the complete migration chain due to prior migrations, so verify against PostgreSQL.

## Known Limitations and Remaining Work

### External Facts to Verify

- [ ] **Exact meaning of Jules 429.** Cannot distinguish daily limit vs. concurrency limit. Currently applies a 24-hour rolling hold in both cases. Requires inspecting actual responses to separate behaviors.
- [ ] **Definition of one Jules "task".** Unclear whether `sendMessage` or repeated PR comments count toward the daily limit.
- [ ] **Jules behavior at concurrency limit.** Unclear whether requests queue (`QUEUED`) or reject immediately.
- [ ] **Completion without output.** Cases of `COMPLETED` status without `outputs` have been observed; currently treated as normal completion (a task session then records "completed without opening a pull request").
- [ ] **`outputs[].pullRequest.url` and `agentMessaged.message` shapes.** Adoption and report storage read these v1alpha fields; neither has been confirmed against a live `AUTO_CREATE_PR` session. Run one before relying on adoption.
- [ ] **Live invocation verification.** Execute live runs of the real Jules API and post-refactor Codex pipeline end-to-end.

### Code

- [ ] Sessions in `AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL` or `AWAITING_USER_FEEDBACK` states continue to hold concurrency slots; approval or feedback is not automated.
- [ ] Title-based reconciliation only checks the latest 300 sessions. Unconfirmed sessions older than that fail after 1 hour.
- [x] The session list pages by offset and filters by `status` (`open`, `completed`, `failed`) and `schedule_config_id`. The UI offers the status filter only.
- [x] 30-day ledger cleanup runs when inserting a record and prunes every catalog, so an idle catalog keeps no expired rows. The table only grows through that insert, so no separate schedule is needed.
- [x] Catalogs are selected per project, and a pull request can designate one (`@auto-run:<key or kind>`, `catalog` on enrollment). Automatic routing is deferred; `resolve_catalog` is where it would go.
- [x] Jules task sessions' pull requests are adopted into the pipeline (`implemented=True` enrollment). Applying `changeSet.gitPatch` to an existing PR branch remains unimplemented.
- [ ] A report is only kept as the session's final message. If a report should live in git history, add a delivery mode where Jules writes `reports/<date>.md` and the hub reads the file from the pull request head before closing it.
- [ ] Jules cannot post to the hub itself. A hub ingest endpoint with a per-session token is possible (Jules calls GitHub with an environment token today) but was deferred: prompt-dependent delivery still needs the polling reconciliation that exists now.
- [ ] `alembic check` reports 2 comment discrepancies with models: `pipeline_runs.pull_snapshot`, `schedule_configs.next_run_at`. Unrelated to AI Catalog.
